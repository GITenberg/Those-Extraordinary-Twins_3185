    <p>
      A man who is not born with the novel-writing gift has a troublesome time
      of it when he tries to build a novel. I know this from experience. He has
      no clear idea of his story; in fact he has no story. He merely has some
      people in his mind, and an incident or two, also a locality. He knows
      these people, he knows the selected locality, and he trusts that he can
      plunge those people into those incidents with interesting results. So he
      goes to work. To write a novel? No&mdash;that is a thought which comes
      later; in the beginning he is only proposing to tell a little tale; a very
      little tale; a six-page tale. But as it is a tale which he is not
      acquainted with, and can only find out what it is by listening as it goes
      along telling itself, it is more than apt to go on and on and on till it
      spreads itself into a book. I know about this, because it has happened to
      me so many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I have noticed another thing: that as the short tale grows into a long
      tale, the original intention (or motif) is apt to get abolished and find
      itself superseded by a quite different one. It was so in the case of a
      magazine sketch which I once started to write&mdash;a funny and fantastic
      sketch about a prince and a pauper; it presently assumed a grave cast of
      its own accord, and in that new shape spread itself out into a book. Much
      the same thing happened with &ldquo;Pudd'nhead Wilson.&rdquo; I had a sufficiently
      hard time with that tale, because it changed itself from a farce to a
      tragedy while I was going along with it&mdash;a most embarrassing
      circumstance. But what was a great deal worse was, that it was not one
      story, but two stories tangled together; and they obstructed and
      interrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion and
      annoyance. I could not offer the book for publication, for I was afraid it
      would unseat the reader's reason. I did not know what was the matter with
      it, for I had not noticed, as yet, that it was two stories in one. It took
      me months to make that discovery. I carried the manuscript back and forth
      across the Atlantic two or three times, and read it and studied over it on
      shipboard; and at last I saw where the difficulty lay. I had no further
      trouble. I pulled one of the stories out by the roots, and left the other
      one&mdash;a kind of literary Caesarean operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would the reader care to know something about the story which I pulled
      out? He has been told many a time how the born-and-trained novelist works.
      Won't he let me round and complete his knowledge by telling him how the
      jack-leg does it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally the story was called &ldquo;Those Extraordinary Twins.&rdquo; I meant to
      make it very short. I had seen a picture of a youthful Italian &ldquo;freak&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;freaks&rdquo; which was&mdash;or which were&mdash;on exhibition in our cities&mdash;a
      combination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a single body
      and a single pair of legs&mdash;and I thought I would write an
      extravagantly fantastic little story with this freak of nature for hero&mdash;or
      heroes&mdash;a silly young miss for heroine, and two old ladies and two
      boys for the minor parts. I lavishly elaborated these people and their
      doings, of course. But the tale kept spreading along, and spreading along,
      and other people got to intruding themselves and taking up more and more
      room with their talk and their affairs. Among them came a stranger named
      Pudd'nhead Wilson, and a woman named Roxana; and presently the doings of
      these two pushed up into prominence a young fellow named Tom Driscoll,
      whose proper place was away in the obscure background. Before the book was
      half finished those three were taking things almost entirely into their
      own hands and working the whole tale as a private venture of their own&mdash;a
      tale which they had nothing at all to do with, by rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the book was finished and I came to look around to see what had
      become of the team I had originally started out with&mdash;Aunt Patsy
      Cooper, Aunt Betsy Hale, the two boys, and Rowena the light-weight heroine&mdash;they
      were nowhere to be seen; they had disappeared from the story some time or
      other. I hunted about and found them&mdash;found them stranded, idle,
      forgotten, and permanently useless. It was very awkward. It was awkward
      all around; but more particularly in the case of Rowena, because there was
      a love-match on, between her and one of the twins that constituted the
      freak, and I had worked it up to a blistering heat and thrown in a quite
      dramatic love-quarrel, wherein Rowena scathingly denounced her betrothed
      for getting drunk, and scoffed at his explanation of how it had happened,
      and wouldn't listen to it, and had driven him from her in the usual
      &ldquo;forever&rdquo; way; and now here she sat crying and broken-hearted; for she had
      found that he had spoken only the truth; that it was not he, but the other
      half of the freak, that had drunk the liquor that made him drunk; that her
      half was a prohibitionist and had never drunk a drop in his life, and,
      although tight as a brick three days in the week, was wholly innocent of
      blame; and indeed, when sober, was constantly doing all he could to reform
      his brother, the other half, who never got any satisfaction out of
      drinking, anyway, because liquor never affected him. Yes, here she was,
      stranded with that deep injustice of hers torturing her poor torn heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't know what to do with her. I was as sorry for her as anybody could
      be, but the campaign was over, the book was finished, she was sidetracked,
      and there was no possible way of crowding her in, anywhere. I could not
      leave her there, of course; it would not do. After spreading her out so,
      and making such a to-do over her affairs, it would be absolutely necessary
      to account to the reader for her. I thought and thought and studied and
      studied; but I arrived at nothing. I finally saw plainly that there was
      really no way but one&mdash;I must simply give her the grand bounce. It
      grieved me to do it, for after associating with her so much I had come to
      kind of like her after a fashion, notwithstanding she was such an ass and
      said such stupid irritating things and was so nauseatingly sentimental.
      Still it had to be done. So, at the top of Chapter XVII, I put in a
      &ldquo;Calendar&rdquo; remark concerning July the Fourth, and began the chapter with
      this statistic:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rowena went out in the back yard after supper to see the fireworks and
      fell down the well and got drowned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed abrupt, but I thought maybe the reader wouldn't notice it,
      because I changed the subject right away to something else. Anyway it
      loosened up Rowena from where she was stuck and got her out of the way,
      and that was the main thing. It seemed a prompt good way of weeding out
      people that had got stalled, and a plenty good enough way for those
      others; so I hunted up the two boys and said &ldquo;they went out back one night
      to stone the cat and fell down the well and got drowned.&rdquo; Next I searched
      around and found old Aunt Patsy Cooper and Aunt Betsy Hale where they were
      aground, and said &ldquo;they went out back one night to visit the sick and fell
      down the well and got drowned.&rdquo; I was going to drown some of the others,
      but I gave up the idea, partly because I believed that if I kept that up
      it would arouse attention, and perhaps sympathy with those people, and
      partly because it was not a large well and would not hold any more anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the story was unsatisfactory. Here was a set of new characters who
      were become inordinately prominent and who persisted in remaining so to
      the end; and back yonder was an older set who made a large noise and a
      great to-do for a little while and then suddenly played out utterly and
      fell down the well. There was a radical defect somewhere, and I must
      search it out and cure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The defect turned out to be the one already spoken of&mdash;two stories in
      one, a farce and a tragedy. So I pulled out the farce and left the
      tragedy. This left the original team in, but only as mere names, not as
      characters. Their prominence was wholly gone; they were not even worth
      drowning; so I removed that detail. Also I took those twins apart and made
      two separate men of them. They had no occasion to have foreign names now,
      but it was too much trouble to remove them all through, so I left them
      christened as they were and made no explanation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE TWINS AS THEY REALLY WERE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The conglomerate twins were brought on the stage in Chapter I of the
      original extravaganza. Aunt Patsy Cooper has received their letter
      applying for board and lodging, and Rowena, her daughter, insane with joy,
      is begging for a hearing of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, set down then, and be quiet a minute and don't fly around so; it
      fairly makes me tired to see you. It starts off so: 'HONORED MADAM'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that, ma, don't you? It shows they're high-bred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I noticed that when I first read it. 'My brother and I have seen
      your advertisement, by chance, in a copy of your local journal&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so beautiful and smooth, ma-don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, seems so to me&mdash;'and beg leave to take the room you offer. We
      are twenty-four years of age, and twins&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twins! How sweet! I do hope they are handsome, and I just know they are!
      Don't you hope they are, ma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land, I ain't particular. 'We are Italians by birth&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so romantic! Just think there's never been one in this town, and
      everybody will want to see them, and they're all ours! Think of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;'but have lived long in the various countries of Europe, and
      several years in the United States.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just think what wonders they've seen, ma! Won't it be good to hear
      them talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon so; yes, I reckon so. 'Our names are Luigi and Angelo Capello&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful, perfectly beautiful! Not like Jones and Robinson and those
      horrible names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You desire but one guest, but dear madam, if you will allow us to pay
      for two we will not discommode you. We will sleep together in the same
      bed. We have always been used to this, and prefer it.' And then he goes on
      to say they will be down Thursday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is Tuesday&mdash;I don't know how I'm ever going to wait, ma!
      The time does drag along so, and I'm so dying to see them! Which of them
      do you reckon is the tallest, ma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you s'pose I can tell, child? Mostly they are the same size-twins
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well then, which do you reckon is the best looking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness knows&mdash;I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Angelo is; it's the prettiest name, anyway. Don't you think it's
      a sweet name, ma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's well enough. I'd like both of them better if I knew the way to
      pronounce them&mdash;the Eyetalian way, I mean. The Missouri way and the
      Eyetalian way is different, I judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe&mdash;yes. It's Luigi that writes the letter. What do you reckon is
      the reason Angelo didn't write it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how can I tell? What's the difference who writes it, so long as it's
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope it wasn't because he is sick! You don't think he is sick, do
      you, ma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick your granny; what's to make him sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's never any telling. These foreigners with that kind of names
      are so delicate, and of course that kind of names are not suited to our
      climate&mdash;you wouldn't expect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [And so-on and so-on, no end. The time drags along; Thursday comes: the
      boat arrives in a pouring storm toward midnight.]
    </p>
    <p>
      At last there was a knock at the door and the anxious family jumped to
      open it. Two negro men entered, each carrying a trunk, and proceeded
      upstairs toward the guest-room. Then followed a stupefying apparition&mdash;a
      double-headed human creature with four arms, one body, and a single pair
      of legs! It&mdash;or they, as you please&mdash;bowed with elaborate
      foreign formality, but the Coopers could not respond immediately; they
      were paralyzed. At this moment there came from the rear of the group a
      fervent ejaculation&mdash;&ldquo;My lan'!&rdquo;&mdash;followed by a crash of
      crockery, and the slave-wench Nancy stood petrified and staring, with a
      tray of wrecked tea-things at her feet. The incident broke the spell, and
      brought the family to consciousness. The beautiful heads of the new-comer
      bowed again, and one of them said with easy grace and dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave the honor, madam and miss, to introduce to you my brother, Count
      Luigi Capello,&rdquo; (the other head bowed) &ldquo;and myself&mdash;Count Angelo; and
      at the same time offer sincere apologies for the lateness of our coming,
      which was unavoidable,&rdquo; and both heads bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old lady was in a whirl of amazement and confusion, but she
      managed to stammer out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I'm glad to make your acquaintance, sir&mdash;I mean, gentlemen.
      As for the delay, it is nothing, don't mention it. This is my daughter
      Rowena, sir&mdash;gentlemen. Please step into the parlor and sit down and
      have a bite and sup; you are dreadful wet and must be uncomfortable&mdash;both
      of you, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But to the old lady's relief they courteously excused themselves, saying
      it would be wrong to keep the family out of their beds longer; then each
      head bowed in turn and uttered a friendly good night, and the singular
      figure moved away in the wake of Rowena's small brothers, who bore
      candles, and disappeared up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow tottered into the parlor and sank into a chair with a gasp, and
      Rowena followed, tongue-tied and dazed. The two sat silent in the
      throbbing summer heat unconscious of the million-voiced music of the
      mosquitoes, unconscious of the roaring gale, the lashing and thrashing of
      the rain along the windows and the roof, the white glare of the lightning,
      the tumultuous booming and bellowing of the thunder; conscious of nothing
      but that prodigy, that uncanny apparition that had come and gone so
      suddenly&mdash;that weird strange thing that was so soft-spoken and so
      gentle of manner and yet had shaken them up like an earthquake with the
      shock of its gruesome aspect. At last a cold little shudder quivered along
      down the widow's meager frame and she said in a weak voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh, it was awful just the mere look of that phillipene!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowena did not answer. Her faculties were still caked; she had not yet
      found her voice. Presently the widow said, a little resentfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always been used to sleeping together&mdash;in-fact, prefer it. And I was
      thinking it was to accommodate me. I thought it was very good of them,
      whereas a person situated as that young man is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma, you oughtn't to begin by getting up a prejudice against him. I'm sure
      he is good-hearted and means well. Both of his faces show it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so certain about that. The one on the left&mdash;I mean the one
      on it's left&mdash;hasn't near as good a face, in my opinion, as its
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Luigi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Luigi; anyway it's the dark-skinned one; the one that was west of
      his brother when they stood in the door. Up to all kinds of mischief and
      disobedience when he was a boy, I'll be bound. I lay his mother had
      trouble to lay her hand on him when she wanted him. But the one on the
      right is as good as gold, I can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Angelo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Angelo, I reckon, though I can't tell t'other from which by their
      names, yet awhile. But it's the right-hand one&mdash;the blond one. He has
      such kind blue eyes, and curly copper hair and fresh complexion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such a noble face!&mdash;oh, it is a noble face, ma, just royal, you
      may say! And beautiful deary me, how beautiful! But both are that; the
      dark one's as beautiful as&mdash;a picture. There's no such wonderful
      faces and handsome heads in this town none that even begin. And such
      hands, especially Angelo's&mdash;so shapely and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff, how could you tell which they belonged to?&mdash;they had gloves
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, didn't I see them take off their hats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That don't signify. They might have taken off each other's hats. Nobody
      could tell. There was just a wormy squirming of arms in the air&mdash;seemed
      to be a couple of dozen of them, all writhing at once, and it just made me
      dizzy to see them go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma, I hadn't any difficulty. There's two arms on each shoulder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now. One arm on each shoulder belongs to each of the creatures,
      don't it? For a person to have two arms on one shoulder wouldn't do him
      any good, would it? Of course not. Each has an arm on each shoulder. Now
      then, you tell me which of them belongs to which, if you can. They don't
      know, themselves&mdash;they just work whichever arm comes handy. Of course
      they do; especially if they are in a hurry and can't stop to think which
      belongs to which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother seemed to have the rights of the argument, so the daughter
      abandoned the struggle. Presently the widow rose with a yawn and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing, I hope it won't catch cold; it was powerful wet, just
      drenched, you may say. I hope it has left its boots outside, so they can
      be dried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she gave a little start, and looked perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I remember I heard one of them ask Joe to call him at half after
      seven&mdash;I think it was the one on the left&mdash;no, it was the one to
      the east of the other one&mdash;but I didn't hear the other one say any
      thing. I wonder if he wants to be called too. Do you reckon it's too late
      to ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma, it's not necessary. Calling one is calling both. If one gets up,
      the other's got to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho, of course; I never thought of that. Well, come along, maybe we can
      get some sleep, but I don't know, I'm so shook up with what we've been
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger had made an impression on the boys, too. They had a word of
      talk as they were getting to bed. Henry, the gentle, the humane, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel ever so sorry for it, don't you, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Joe was a boy of this world, active, enterprising, and had a
      theatrical side to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry? Why, how you talk! It can't stir a step without attracting
      attention. It's just grand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry said, reproachfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of pitying it, Joe, you talk as if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk as if what? I know one thing mighty certain: if you can fix me so I
      can eat for two and only have to stub toes for one, I ain't going to fool
      away no such chance just for sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The twins were wet and tired, and they proceeded to undress without any
      preliminary remarks. The abundance of sleeve made the partnership coat
      hard to get off, for it was like skinning a tarantula; but it came at
      last, after much tugging and perspiring. The mutual vest followed. Then
      the brothers stood up before the glass, and each took off his own cravat
      and collar. The collars were of the standing kind, and came high up under
      the ears, like the sides of a wheelbarrow, as required by the fashion of
      the day. The cravats were as broad as a bankbill, with fringed ends which
      stood far out to right and left like the wings of a dragon-fly, and this
      also was strictly in accordance with the fashion of the time. Each cravat,
      as to color, was in perfect taste, so far as its owner's complexion was
      concerned&mdash;a delicate pink, in the case of the blond brother, a
      violent scarlet in the case of the brunette&mdash;but as a combination
      they broke all the laws of taste known to civilization. Nothing more
      fiendish and irreconcilable than those shrieking and blaspheming colors
      could have been contrived. The wet boots gave no end of trouble&mdash;to
      Luigi. When they were off at last, Angelo said, with bitterness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't wear such tight boots, they hurt my feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luigi answered with indifference:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, when I am in command of our body, I choose my apparel
      according to my own convenience, as I have remarked more than several
      times already. When you are in command, I beg you will do as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angelo was hurt, and the tears came into his eyes. There was gentle
      reproach in his voice, but, not anger, when he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luigi, I often consult your wishes, but you never consult mine. When I am
      in command I treat you as a guest; I try to make you feel at home; when
      you are in command you treat me as an intruder, you make me feel
      unwelcome. It embarrasses me cruelly in company, for I can see that people
      notice it and comment on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn the people,&rdquo; responded the brother languidly, and with the air
      of one who is tired of the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight shudder shook the frame of Angelo, but he said nothing and the
      conversation ceased. Each buttoned his own share of the nightshirt in
      silence; then Luigi, with Paine's Age of Reason in his hand, sat down in
      one chair and put his feet in another and lit his pipe, while Angelo took
      his Whole Duty of Man, and both began to read. Angelo presently began to
      cough; his coughing increased and became mixed with gaspings for breath,
      and he was finally obliged to make an appeal to his brother's humanity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luigi, if you would only smoke a little milder tobacco, I am sure I could
      learn not to mind it in time, but this is so strong, and the pipe is so
      rank that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angelo, I wouldn't be such a baby! I have learned to smoke in a week, and
      the trouble is already over with me; if you would try, you could learn
      too, and then you would stop spoiling my comfort with your everlasting
      complaints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, brother, that is a strong word&mdash;everlasting&mdash;and isn't
      quite fair. I only complain when I suffocate; you know I don't complain
      when we are in the open air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway, you could learn to smoke yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my principles, Luigi, you forget my principles. You would not have me
      do a thing which I regard as a sin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation ceased again, for Angelo was sick and discouraged and
      strangling; but after some time he closed his book and asked Luigi to sing
      &ldquo;From Greenland's Icy Mountains&rdquo; with him, but he would not, and when he
      tried to sing by himself Luigi did his best to drown his plaintive tenor
      with a rude and rollicking song delivered in a thundering bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the singing there was silence, and neither brother was happy. Before
      blowing the light out Luigi swallowed half a tumbler of whisky, and
      Angelo, whose sensitive organization could not endure intoxicants of any
      kind, took a pill to keep it from giving him the headache.

      CHAPTER II. MA COOPER GETS ALL MIXED UP
    </h2>
    <p>
      The family sat in the breakfast-room waiting for the twins to come down.
      The widow was quiet, the daughter was alive with happy excitement. She
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, they're a boon, ma, just a boon! Don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws, I hope so, I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma, yes you do. They're so fine and handsome, and high-bred and
      polite, so every way superior to our gawks here in this village; why,
      they'll make life different from what it was&mdash;so humdrum and
      commonplace, you know&mdash;oh, you may be sure they're full of
      accomplishments, and knowledge of the world, and all that, that will be an
      immense advantage to society here. Don't you think so, ma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on me, how should I know, and I've hardly set eyes on them yet.&rdquo;
       After a pause she added, &ldquo;They made considerable noise after they went
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noise? Why, ma, they were singing! And it was beautiful, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was well enough, but too mixed-up, seemed to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, ma, honor bright, did you ever hear 'Greenland's Icy Mountains' sung
      sweeter&mdash;now did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it had been sung by itself, it would have been uncommon sweet, I don't
      deny it; but what they wanted to mix it up with 'Old Bob Ridley' for, I
      can't make out. Why, they don't go together, at all. They are not of the
      same nature. 'Bob Ridley' is a common rackety slam-bang secular song, one
      of the rippingest and rantingest and noisiest there is. I am no judge of
      music, and I don't claim it, but in my opinion nobody can make those two
      songs go together right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma, I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't make any difference what you thought, it can't be done. They
      tried it, and to my mind it was a failure. I never heard such a crazy
      uproar; seemed to me, sometimes, the roof would come off; and as for the
      cats&mdash;well, I've lived a many a year, and seen cats aggravated in
      more ways than one, but I've never seen cats take on the way they took on
      last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't think that that goes for anything, ma, because it is the
      nature of cats that any sound that is unusual&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unusual! You may well call it so. Now if they are going to sing duets
      every night, I do hope they will both sing the same tune at the same time,
      for in my opinion a duet that is made up of two different tunes is a
      mistake; especially when the tunes ain't any kin to one another, that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, ma, I think it must be a foreign custom; and it must be right too;
      and the best way, because they have had every opportunity to know what is
      right, and it don't stand to reason that with their education they would
      do anything but what the highest musical authorities have sanctioned. You
      can't help but admit that, ma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The argument was formidably strong; the old lady could not find any way
      around it; so, after thinking it over awhile she gave in with a sigh of
      discontent, and admitted that the daughter's position was probably
      correct. Being vanquished, she had no mind to continue the topic at that
      disadvantage, and was about to seek a change when a change came of itself.
      A footstep was heard on the stairs, and she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There-he's coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They, ma&mdash;you ought to say they&mdash;it's nearer right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new lodger, rather shoutingly dressed but looking superbly handsome,
      stepped with courtly carnage into the trim little breakfast-room and put
      out all his cordial arms at once, like one of those pocket-knives with a
      multiplicity of blades, and shook hands with the whole family
      simultaneously. He was so easy and pleasant and hearty that all
      embarrassment presently thawed away and disappeared, and a cheery feeling
      of friendliness and comradeship took its place. He&mdash;or preferably
      they&mdash;were asked to occupy the seat of honor at the foot of the
      table. They consented with thanks, and carved the beefsteak with one set
      of their hands while they distributed it at the same time with the other
      set.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have coffee, gentlemen, or tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee for Luigi, if you please, madam, tea for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cream and sugar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me, yes, madam; Luigi takes his coffee, black. Our natures differ a
      good deal from each other, and our tastes also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first time the negro girl Nancy appeared in the door and saw the two
      heads turned in opposite directions and both talking at once, then saw the
      commingling arms feed potatoes into one mouth and coffee into the other at
      the same time, she had to pause and pull herself out of a faintness that
      came over her; but after that she held her grip and was able to wait on
      the table with fair courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation fell naturally into the customary grooves. It was a little
      jerky, at first, because none of the family could get smoothly through a
      sentence without a wabble in it here and a break there, caused by some new
      surprise in the way of attitude or gesture on the part of the twins. The
      weather suffered the most. The weather was all finished up and disposed
      of, as a subject, before the simple Missourians had gotten sufficiently
      wonted to the spectacle of one body feeding two heads to feel composed and
      reconciled in the presence of so bizarre a miracle. And even after
      everybody's mind became tranquilized there was still one slight
      distraction left: the hand that picked up a biscuit carried it to the
      wrong head, as often as any other way, and the wrong mouth devoured it.
      This was a puzzling thing, and marred the talk a little. It bothered the
      widow to such a degree that she presently dropped out of the conversation
      without knowing it, and fell to watching and guessing and talking to
      herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that hand is going to take that coffee to&mdash;no, it's gone to the
      other mouth; I can't understand it; and Now, here is the dark-complected
      hand with a potato in its fork, I'll see what goes with it&mdash;there,
      the light-complected head's got it, as sure as I live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finally Rowena said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma, what is the matter with you? Are you dreaming about something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady came to herself and blushed; then she explained with the
      first random thing that came into her mind: &ldquo;I saw Mr. Angelo take up Mr.
      Luigi's coffee, and I thought maybe he&mdash;sha'n't I give you a cup, Mr.
      Angelo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, madam, I am very much obliged, but I never drink coffee, much as I
      would like to. You did see me take up Luigi's cup, it is true, but if you
      noticed, I didn't carry it to my mouth, but to his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-es, I thought you did: Did you mean to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The widow was a little embarrassed again. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know but what I'm foolish, and you mustn't mind; but you see, he
      got the coffee I was expecting to see you drink, and you got a potato that
      I thought he was going to get. So I thought it might be a mistake all
      around, and everybody getting what wasn't intended for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both twins laughed and Luigi said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear madam, there wasn't any mistake. We are always helping each other
      that way. It is a great economy for us both; it saves time and labor. We
      have a system of signs which nobody can notice or understand but
      ourselves. If I am using both my hands and want some coffee, I make the
      sign and Angelo furnishes it to me; and you saw that when he needed a
      potato I delivered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How convenient!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and often of the extremest value. Take the Mississippi boats, for
      instance. They are always overcrowded. There is table-room for only half
      of the passengers, therefore they have to set a second table for the
      second half. The stewards rush both parties, they give them no time to eat
      a satisfying meal, both divisions leave the table hungry. It isn't so with
      us. Angelo books himself for the one table, I book myself for the other.
      Neither of us eats anything at the other's table, but just simply works&mdash;works.
      Thus, you see there are four hands to feed Angelo, and the same four to
      feed me. Each of us eats two meals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was dazed with admiration, and kept saying, &ldquo;It is perfectly
      wonderful, perfectly wonderful&rdquo; and the boy Joe licked his chops
      enviously, but said nothing&mdash;at least aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Luigi, &ldquo;our construction may have its disadvantages&mdash;in
      fact, HAS&mdash;but it also has its compensations of one sort and another.
      Take travel, for instance. Travel is enormously expensive, in all
      countries; we have been obliged to do a vast deal of it&mdash;come,
      Angelo, don't put any more sugar in your tea, I'm just over one
      indigestion and don't want another right away&mdash;been obliged to do a
      deal of it, as I was saying. Well, we always travel as one person, since
      we occupy but one seat; so we save half the fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How romantic!&rdquo; interjected Rowena, with effusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear young lady, and how practical too, and economical. In
      Europe, beds in the hotels are not charged with the board, but separately&mdash;another
      saving, for we stood to our rights and paid for the one bed only. The
      landlords often insisted that as both of us occupied the bed we ought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they didn't,&rdquo; said Angelo. &ldquo;They did it only twice, and in both cases
      it was a double bed&mdash;a rare thing in Europe&mdash;and the double bed
      gave them some excuse. Be fair to the landlords; twice doesn't constitute
      'often.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that depends&mdash;that depends. I knew a man who fell down a well
      twice. He said he didn't mind the first time, but he thought the second
      time was once too often. Have I misused that word, Mrs. Cooper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth, I was afraid you had, but it seems to look, now, like
      you hadn't.&rdquo; She stopped, and was evidently struggling with the difficult
      problem a moment, then she added in the tone of one who is convinced
      without being converted, &ldquo;It seems so, but I can't somehow tell why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowena thought Luigi's retort was wonderfully quick and bright, and she
      remarked to herself with satisfaction that there wasn't any young native
      of Dawson's Landing that could have risen to the occasion like that. Luigi
      detected the applause in her face, and expressed his pleasure and his
      thanks with his eyes; and so eloquently withal, that the girl was proud
      and pleased, and hung out the delicate sign of it on her cheeks. Luigi
      went on, with animation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of us get a bath for one ticket, theater seat for one ticket,
      pew-rent is on the same basis, but at peep-shows we pay double.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have much to be thankful for,&rdquo; said Angelo, impressively, with a
      reverent light in his eye and a reminiscent tone in his voice, &ldquo;we have
      been greatly blessed. As a rule, what one of us has lacked, the other, by
      the bounty of Providence, has been able to supply. My brother is hardy, I
      am not; he is very masculine, assertive, aggressive; I am much less so. I
      am subject to illness, he is never ill. I cannot abide medicines, and
      cannot take them, but he has no prejudice against them, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, goodness gracious,&rdquo; interrupted the widow, &ldquo;when you are sick, does
      he take the medicine for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I never heard such a thing in my life! I think it's beautiful of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madam, it's nothing, don't mention it, it's really nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I say it's beautiful, and I stick to it!&rdquo; cried the widow, with a
      speaking moisture in her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A well brother to take the medicine for his poor sick brother&mdash;I
      wish I had such a son,&rdquo; and she glanced reproachfully at her boys. &ldquo;I
      declare I'll never rest till I've shook you by the hand,&rdquo; and she
      scrambled out of her chair in a fever of generous enthusiasm, and made for
      the twins, blind with her tears, and began to shake. The boy Joe corrected
      her: &ldquo;You're shaking the wrong one, ma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This flurried her, but she made a swift change and went on shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got the wrong one again, ma,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut up, can't you!&rdquo; said the widow, embarrassed and irritated. &ldquo;Give
      me all your hands, I want to shake them all; for I know you are both just
      as good as you can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a victorious thought, a master-stroke of diplomacy, though that
      never occurred to her and she cared nothing for diplomacy. She shook the
      four hands in turn cordially, and went back to her place in a state of
      high and fine exultation that made her look young and handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I owe everything to Luigi,&rdquo; said Angelo, affectionately. &ldquo;But for
      him I could not have survived our boyhood days, when we were friendless
      and poor&mdash;ah, so poor! We lived from hand to mouth-lived on the
      coarse fare of unwilling charity, and for weeks and weeks together not a
      morsel of food passed my lips, for its character revolted me and I could
      not eat it. But for Luigi I should have died. He ate for us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How noble!&rdquo; sighed Rowena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; said the widow, severely, to her boys. &ldquo;Let it be an
      example to you&mdash;I mean you, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe gave his head a barely perceptible disparaging toss and said: &ldquo;Et for
      both. It ain't anything I'd 'a' done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, if you haven't got any better manners than that. You don't see the
      point at all. It wasn't good food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care&mdash;it was food, and I'd 'a' et it if it was rotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame! Such language! Can't you understand? They were starving&mdash;actually
      starving&mdash;and he ate for both, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! you gimme a chance and I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now&mdash;close your head! and don't you open it again till you're
      asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Angelo goes on and tells how his parents the Count and Countess had
     to fly from Florence for political reasons, and died poor in Berlin
     bereft of their great property by confiscation; and how he and Luigi
     had to travel with a freak-show during two years and suffer
     semi-starvation.]
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That hateful black-bread; but I seldom ate anything during that time;
      that was poor Luigi's affair&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never Mister him again!&rdquo; cried the widow, with strong emotion, &ldquo;he's
      Luigi to me, from this out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you a thousand times, madam, a thousand times! though in truth I
      don't deserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Luigi is always the fortunate one when honors are showering,&rdquo; said
      Angelo, plaintively; &ldquo;now what have I done, Mrs. Cooper, that you leave me
      out? Come, you must strain a point in my favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call you Angelo? Why, certainly I will; what are you thinking of! In the
      case of twins, why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, ma, you're breaking up the story&mdash;do let him go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep still, Rowena Cooper, and he can go on all the better, I reckon.
      One interruption don't hurt, it's two that makes the trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you've added one, now, and that is three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rowena! I will not allow you to talk back at me when you have got nothing
      rational to say.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III. ANGELO IS BLUE
    </h2>
    <p>
      [After breakfast the whole village crowded in, and there was a grand
      reception in honor of the twins; and at the close of it the gifted &ldquo;freak&rdquo;
       captured everybody's admiration by sitting down at the piano and knocking
      out a classic four-handed piece in great style. Then the judge took it&mdash;or
      them&mdash;driving in his buggy and showed off his village.]
    </p>
    <p>
      All along the streets the people crowded the windows and stared at the
      amazing twins. Troops of small boys flocked after the buggy, excited and
      yelling. At first the dogs showed no interest. They thought they merely
      saw three men in a buggy&mdash;a matter of no consequence; but when they
      found out the facts of the case, they altered their opinion pretty
      radically, and joined the boys, expressing their minds as they came. Other
      dogs got interested; indeed, all the dogs. It was a spirited sight to see
      them come leaping fences, tearing around corners, swarming out of every
      bystreet and alley. The noise they made was something beyond belief&mdash;or
      praise. They did not seem to be moved by malice but only by prejudice, the
      common human prejudice against lack of conformity. If the twins turned
      their heads, they broke and fled in every direction, but stopped at a safe
      distance and faced about; and then formed and came on again as soon as the
      strangers showed them their back. Negroes and farmers' wives took to the
      woods when the buggy came upon them suddenly, and altogether the drive was
      pleasant and animated, and a refreshment all around.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [It was a long and lively drive.  Angelo was a Methodist, Luigi was
     a Free-thinker.  The judge was very proud of his Freethinkers'
     Society, which was flourishing along in a most prosperous way and
     already had two members&mdash;himself and the obscure and neglected
     Pudd'nhead Wilson.  It was to meet that evening, and he invited
     Luigi to join; a thing which Luigi was glad to do, partly because it
     would please himself, and partly because it would gravel Angelo.]
</pre>
    <p>
      They had now arrived at the widow's gate, and the excursion was ended. The
      twins politely expressed their obligations for the pleasant outing which
      had been afforded them; to which the judge bowed his thanks, and then said
      he would now go and arrange for the Free-thinkers' meeting, and would call
      for Count Luigi in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you also, dear sir,&rdquo; he added hastily, turning to Angelo and bowing.
      &ldquo;In addressing myself particularly to your brother, I was not meaning to
      leave you out. It was an unintentional rudeness, I assure you, and due
      wholly to accident&mdash;accident and preoccupation. I beg you to forgive
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His quick eye had seen the sensitive blood mount into Angelo's face,
      betraying the wound that had been inflicted. The sting of the slight had
      gone deep, but the apology was so prompt, and so evidently sincere, that
      the hurt was almost immediately healed, and a forgiving smile testified to
      the kindly judge that all was well again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concealed behind Angelo's modest and unassuming exterior, and unsuspected
      by any but his intimates, was a lofty pride, a pride of almost abnormal
      proportions, indeed, and this rendered him ever the prey of slights; and
      although they were almost always imaginary ones, they hurt none the less
      on that account. By ill fortune judge Driscoll had happened to touch his
      sorest point, i.e., his conviction that his brother's presence was
      welcomer everywhere than his own; that he was often invited, out of mere
      courtesy, where only his brother was wanted, and that in a majority of
      cases he would not be included in an invitation if he could be left out
      without offense. A sensitive nature like this is necessarily subject to
      moods; moods which traverse the whole gamut of feeling; moods which know
      all the climes of emotion, from the sunny heights of joy to the black
      abysses of despair. At times, in his seasons of deepest depressions,
      Angelo almost wished that he and his brother might become segregated from
      each other and be separate individuals, like other men. But of course as
      soon as his mind cleared and these diseased imaginings passed away, he
      shuddered at the repulsive thought, and earnestly prayed that it might
      visit him no more. To be separate, and as other men are! How awkward it
      would seem; how unendurable. What would he do with his hands, his arms?
      How would his legs feel? How odd, and strange, and grotesque every action,
      attitude, movement, gesture would be. To sleep by himself, eat by himself,
      walk by himself&mdash;how lonely, how unspeakably lonely! No, no, any fate
      but that. In every way and from every point, the idea was revolting.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was of course natural; to have felt otherwise would have been
      unnatural. He had known no life but a combined one; he had been familiar
      with it from his birth; he was not able to conceive of any other as being
      agreeable, or even bearable. To him, in the privacy of his secret
      thoughts, all other men were monsters, deformities: and during
      three-fourths of his life their aspect had filled him with what promised
      to be an unconquerable aversion. But at eighteen his eye began to take
      note of female beauty; and little by little, undefined longings grew up in
      his heart, under whose softening influences the old stubborn aversion
      gradually diminished, and finally disappeared. Men were still
      monstrosities to him, still deformities, and in his sober moments he had
      no desire to be like them, but their strange and unsocial and uncanny
      construction was no longer offensive to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had been a hard day for him, physically and mentally. He had been
      called in the morning before he had quite slept off the effects of the
      liquor which Luigi had drunk; and so, for the first half-hour had had the
      seedy feeling, and languor, the brooding depression, the cobwebby mouth
      and druggy taste that come of dissipation and are so ill a preparation for
      bodily or intellectual activities; the long violent strain of the
      reception had followed; and this had been followed, in turn, by the dreary
      sight-seeing, the judge's wearying explanations and laudations of the
      sights, and the stupefying clamor of the dogs. As a congruous conclusion,
      a fitting end, his feelings had been hurt, a slight had been put upon him.
      He would have been glad to forego dinner and betake himself to rest and
      sleep, but he held his peace and said no word, for he knew his brother,
      Luigi, was fresh, unweary, full of life, spirit, energy; he would have
      scoffed at the idea of wasting valuable time on a bed or a sofa, and would
      have refused permission.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. SUPERNATURAL CHRONOMETRY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rowena was dining out, Joe and Harry were belated at play, there were but
      three chairs and four persons that noon at the home dinner-table&mdash;the
      twins, the widow, and her chum, Aunt Betsy Hale. The widow soon perceived
      that Angelo's spirits were as low as Luigi's were high, and also that he
      had a jaded look. Her motherly solicitude was aroused, and she tried to
      get him interested in the talk and win him to a happier frame of mind, but
      the cloud of sadness remained on his countenance. Luigi lent his help,
      too. He used a form and a phrase which he was always accustomed to employ
      in these circumstances. He gave his brother an affectionate slap on the
      shoulder and said, encouragingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, the worst is yet to come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this did no good. It never did. If anything, it made the matter worse,
      as a rule, because it irritated Angelo. This made it a favorite with
      Luigi. By and by the widow said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angelo, you are tired, you've overdone yourself; you go right to bed
      after dinner, and get a good nap and a rest, then you'll be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I would give anything if I could do that, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what's to hender, I'd like to know? Land, the room's yours to do what
      you please with! The idea that you can't do what you like with your own!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you see, there's one prime essential&mdash;an essential of the very
      first importance&mdash;which isn't my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old ladies looked puzzled, and Aunt Betsy Hale said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why bless your heart, how is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my brother's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother's! I don't quite understand. I supposed it belonged to both
      of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it does. But not to both at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is mighty curious; I don't see how it can be. I shouldn't think it
      could be managed that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's a good enough arrangement, and goes very well; in fact, it
      wouldn't do to have it otherwise. I find that the teetotalers and the
      anti-teetotalers hire the use of the same hall for their meetings. Both
      parties don't use it at the same time, do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet they don't!&rdquo; said both old ladies in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, moreover,&rdquo; said Aunt Betsy, &ldquo;the Freethinkers and the Baptist Bible
      class use the same room over the Market house, but you can take my word
      for it they don't mush up together and use it at the same time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Angelo, &ldquo;you understand it now. And it stands to reason
      that the arrangement couldn't be improved. I'll prove it to you. If our
      legs tried to obey two wills, how could we ever get anywhere? I would
      start one way, Luigi would start another, at the same moment&mdash;the
      result would be a standstill, wouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as you are born! Now ain't that wonderful! A body would never
      have thought of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should always be arguing and fussing and disputing over the merest
      trifles. We should lose worlds of time, for we couldn't go down-stairs or
      up, couldn't go to bed, couldn't rise, couldn't wash, couldn't dress,
      couldn't stand up, couldn't sit down, couldn't even cross our legs,
      without calling a meeting first and explaining the case and passing
      resolutions, and getting consent. It wouldn't ever do&mdash;now would it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? Why, it would wear a person out in a week! Did you ever hear anything
      like it, Patsy Cooper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you'll find there's more than one thing about them that ain't
      commonplace,&rdquo; said the widow, with the complacent air of a person with a
      property right in a novelty that is under admiring scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, how ever do you manage it? I don't mind saying I'm suffering
      to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who made us,&rdquo; said Angelo reverently, &ldquo;and with us this difficulty,
      also provided a way out of it. By a mysterious law of our being, each of
      us has utter and indisputable command of our body a week at a time, turn
      and turn about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never! Now ain't that beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is beautiful and infinitely wise and just. The week ends every
      Saturday at midnight to the minute, to the second, to the last shade of a
      fraction of a second, infallibly, unerringly, and in that instant the one
      brother's power over the body vanishes and the other brother takes
      possession, asleep or awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How marvelous are His ways, and past finding out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luigi said: &ldquo;So exactly to the instant does the change come, that during
      our stay in many of the great cities of the world, the public clocks were
      regulated by it; and as hundreds of thousands of private clocks and
      watches were set and corrected in accordance with the public clocks, we
      really furnished the standard time for the entire city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't tell me that He don't do miracles any more! Blowing down the walls
      of Jericho with rams' horns wa'n't as difficult, in my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is not all,&rdquo; said Angelo. &ldquo;A thing that is even more marvelous,
      perhaps, is the fact that the change takes note of longitude and fits
      itself to the meridian we are on. Luigi is in command this week. Now, if
      on Saturday night at a moment before midnight we could fly in an instant
      to a point fifteen degrees west of here, he would hold possession of the
      power another hour, for the change observes local time and no other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betsy Hale was deeply impressed, and said with solemnity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patsy Cooper, for detail it lays over the Passage of the Red Sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I shouldn't go as far as that,&rdquo; said Aunt Patsy, &ldquo;but if you've a
      mind to say Sodom and Gomorrah, I am with you, Betsy Hale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am agreeable, then, though I do think I was right, and I believe Parson
      Maltby would say the same. Well, now, there's another thing. Suppose one
      of you wants to borrow the legs a minute from the one that's got them,
      could he let him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we hardly ever do that. There were disagreeable results, several
      times, and so we very seldom ask or grant the privilege, nowadays, and we
      never even think of such a thing unless the case is extremely urgent.
      Besides, a week's possession at a time seems so little that we can't bear
      to spare a minute of it. People who have the use of their legs all the
      time never think of what a blessing it is, of course. It never occurs to
      them; it's just their natural ordinary condition, and so it does not
      excite them at all. But when I wake up, on Sunday morning, and it's my
      week and I feel the power all through me, oh, such a wave of exultation
      and thanksgiving goes surging over me, and I want to shout 'I can walk! I
      can walk!' Madam, do you ever, at your uprising, want to shout 'I can
      walk! I can walk!'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you poor unfortunate cretur', but I'll never get out of my bed again
      without doing it! Laws, to think I've had this unspeakable blessing all my
      long life and never had the grace to thank the good Lord that gave it to
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears stood in the eyes of both the old ladies and the widow said, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betsy Hale, we have learned something, you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation now drifted wide, but by and by floated back once more to
      that admired detail, the rigid and beautiful impartiality with which the
      possession of power had been distributed, between the twins. Aunt Betsy
      saw in it a far finer justice than human law exhibits in related cases.
      She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion it ain't right noW, and never has been right, the way a
      twin born a quarter of a minute sooner than the other one gets all the
      land and grandeurs and nobilities in the old countries and his brother has
      to go bare and be a nobody. Which of you was born first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angelo's head was resting against Luigi's; weariness had overcome him, and
      for the past five minutes he had been peacefully sleeping. The old ladies
      had dropped their voices to a lulling drone, to help him to steal the rest
      his brother wouldn't take him up-stairs to get. Luigi listened a moment to
      Angelo's regular breathing, then said in a voice barely audible:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were both born at the same time, but I am six months older than he
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land's sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sh! don't wake him up; he wouldn't like my telling this. It has always
      been kept secret till now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how in the world can it be? If you were both born at the same time,
      how can one of you be older than the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very simple, and I assure you it is true. I was born with a full
      crop of hair, he was as bald as an egg for six months. I could walk six
      months before he could make a step. I finished teething six months ahead
      of him. I began to take solids six months before he left the breast. I
      began to talk six months before he could say a word. Last, and absolutely
      unassailable proof, the sutures in my skull closed six months ahead of
      his. Always just that six months' difference to a day. Was that accident?
      Nobody is going to claim that, I'm sure. It was ordained&mdash;it was law&mdash;it
      had its meaning, and we know what that meaning was. Now what does this
      overwhelming body of evidence establish? It establishes just one thing,
      and that thing it establishes beyond any peradventure whatever. Friends,
      we would not have it known for the world, and I must beg you to keep it
      strictly to yourselves, but the truth is, we are no more twins than you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two old ladies were stunned, paralyzed&mdash;petrified, one may almost
      say&mdash;and could only sit and gaze vacantly at each other for some
      moments; then Aunt Betsy Hale said impressively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no getting around proof like that. I do believe it's the most
      amazing thing I ever heard of.&rdquo; She sat silent a moment or two and
      breathing hard with excitement, then she looked up and surveyed the
      strangers steadfastly a little while, and added: &ldquo;Well, it does beat me,
      but I would have took you for twins anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I, so would I,&rdquo; said Aunt Patsy with the emphasis of a certainty
      that is not impaired by any shade of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody would-anybody in the world, I don't care who he is,&rdquo; said Aunt
      Betsy with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't tell,&rdquo; said Luigi, appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no!&rdquo; answered both ladies promptly, &ldquo;you can trust us, don't
      you be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is good of you, and kind. Never let on; treat us always as if we
      were twins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can depend on us,&rdquo; said Aunt Betsy, &ldquo;but it won't be easy, because
      now that I know you ain't you don't seem so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luigi muttered to himself with satisfaction: &ldquo;That swindle has gone
      through without change of cars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not very kind of him to load the poor things up with a secret like
      that, which would be always flying to their tongues' ends every time they
      heard any one speak of the strangers as twins, and would become harder and
      harder to hang on to with every recurrence of the temptation to tell it,
      while the torture of retaining it would increase with every new strain
      that was applied; but he never thought of that, and probably would not
      have worried much about it if he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visitor was announced&mdash;some one to see the twins. They withdrew to
      the parlor, and the two old ladies began to discuss with interest the
      strange things which they had been listening to. When they had finished
      the matter to their satisfaction, and Aunt Betsy rose to go, she stopped
      to ask a question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does things come on between Roweny and Tom Driscoll?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, about the same. He writes tolerable often, and she answers
      tolerable seldom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In St. Louis, I believe, though he's such a gadabout that a body can't be
      very certain of him, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't Roweny know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, like enough. I haven't asked her lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how him and the judge are getting along now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First rate, I believe. Mrs. Pratt says so; and being right in the house,
      and sister to the one and aunt to t'other, of course she ought to know.
      She says the judge is real fond of him when he's away; but frets when he's
      around and is vexed with his ways, and not sorry to have him go again. He
      has been gone three weeks this time&mdash;a pleasant thing for both of
      them, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom's rather harum-scarum, but there ain't anything bad in him, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, he's just young, that's all. Still, twenty-three is old, in one
      way. A young man ought to be earning his living by that time. If Tom were
      doing that, or was even trying to do it, the judge would be a heap better
      satisfied with him. Tom's always going to begin, but somehow he can't seem
      to find just the opening he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, it's partly the judge's own fault. Promising the boy his
      property wasn't the way to set him to earning a fortune of his own. But
      what do you think&mdash;is Roweny beginning to lean any toward him, or
      ain't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Patsy had a secret in her bosom; she wanted to keep it there, but
      nature was too strong for her. She drew Aunt Betsy aside, and said in her
      most confidential and mysterious manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you breathe a syllable to a soul&mdash;I'm going to tell you
      something. In my opinion Tom Driscoll's chances were considerable better
      yesterday than they are to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patsy Cooper, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so, as sure as you're born. I wish you could 'a' been at breakfast
      and seen for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I'm any judge, there's a leaning&mdash;there's a leaning, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My land! Which one of 'em is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say for certain, but I think it's the youngest one&mdash;Anjy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there were hand-shakings, and congratulations, and hopes, and so on,
      and the old ladies parted, perfectly happy&mdash;the one in knowing
      something which the rest of the town didn't, and the other in having been
      the sole person able to furnish that knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor who had called to see the twins was the Rev. Mr. Hotchkiss,
      pastor of the Baptist church. At the reception Angelo had told him he had
      lately experienced a change in his religious views, and was now desirous
      of becoming a Baptist, and would immediately join Mr. Hotchkiss's church.
      There was no time to say more, and the brief talk ended at that point. The
      minister was much gratified, and had dropped in for a moment now, to
      invite the twins to attend his Bible class at eight that evening. Angelo
      accepted, and was expecting Luigi to decline, but he did not, because he
      knew that the Bible class and the Freethinkers met in the same room, and
      he wanted to treat his brother to the embarrassment of being caught in
      free-thinking company.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. GUILT AND INNOCENCE FINELY BLENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      [A long and vigorous quarrel follows, between the twins. And there is
      plenty to quarrel about, for Angelo was always seeking truth, and this
      obliged him to change and improve his religion with frequency, which
      wearied Luigi, and annoyed him too; for he had to be present at each new
      enlistment&mdash;which placed him in the false position of seeming to
      indorse and approve his brother's fickleness; moreover, he had to go to
      Angelo's prohibition meetings, and he hated them. On the other hand, when
      it was his week to command the legs he gave Angelo just cause of
      complaint, for he took him to circuses and horse-races and fandangoes,
      exposing him to all sorts of censure and criticism; and he drank, too; and
      whatever he drank went to Angelo's head instead of his own and made him
      act disgracefully. When the evening was come, the two attended the
      Free-thinkers' meeting, where Angelo was sad and silent; then came the
      Bible class and looked upon him coldly, finding him in such company. Then
      they went to Wilson's house and Chapter XI of Pudd'nhead Wilson follows,
      which tells of the girl seen in Tom Driscoll's room; and closes with the
      kicking of Tom by Luigi at the anti-temperance mass-meeting of the Sons of
      Liberty; with the addition of some account of Roxy's adventures as a
      chamber-maid on a Mississippi boat. Her exchange of the children had been
      flippantly and farcically described in an earlier chapter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning all the town was a-buzz with great news; Pudd'nhead Wilson
      had a law case! The public astonishment was so great and the public
      curiosity so intense, that when the justice of the peace opened his court,
      the place was packed with people and even the windows were full. Everybody
      was flushed and perspiring; the summer heat was almost unendurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Driscoll had brought a charge of assault and battery against the
      twins. Robert Allen was retained by Driscoll, David Wilson by the defense.
      Tom, his native cheerfulness unannihilated by his back-breaking and
      bone-bruising passage across the massed heads of the Sons of Liberty the
      previous night, laughed his little customary laugh, and said to Wilson:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've kept my promise, you see; I'm throwing my business your way. Sooner
      than I was expecting, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very good of you&mdash;particularly if you mean to keep it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can't tell about that yet. But we'll see. If I find you deserve
      it I'll take you under my protection and make your fame and fortune for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll try to deserve it, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A jury was sworn in; then Mr. Allen said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will detain your honor but a moment with this case. It is not one
      where any doubt of the fact of the assault can enter in. These gentlemen&mdash;the
      accused&mdash;kicked my client at the Market Hall last night; they kicked
      him with violence; with extraordinary violence; with even unprecedented
      violence, I may say; insomuch that he was lifted entirely off his feet and
      discharged into the midst of the audience. We can prove this by four
      hundred witnesses&mdash;we shall call but three. Mr. Harkness will take
      the stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harkness, being sworn, testified that he was chairman upon the
      occasion mentioned; that he was close at hand and saw the defendants in
      this action kick the plaintiff into the air and saw him descend among the
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the witness,&rdquo; said Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harkness,&rdquo; said Wilson, &ldquo;you say you saw these gentlemen, my clients,
      kick the plaintiff. Are you sure&mdash;and please remember that you are on
      oath&mdash;are you perfectly sure that you saw both of them kick him, or
      only one? Now be careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bewildered look began to spread itself over the witness's face. He
      hesitated, stammered, but got out nothing. His eyes wandered to the twins
      and fixed themselves there with a vacant gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please answer, Mr. Harkness, you are keeping the court waiting. It is a
      very simple question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Counsel for the prosecution broke in with impatience:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor, the question is an irrelevant triviality. Necessarily, they
      both kicked him, for they have but the one pair of legs, and both are
      responsible for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilson said, sarcastically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your honor permit this new witness to be sworn? He seems to possess
      knowledge which can be of the utmost value just at this moment&mdash;knowledge
      which would at once dispose of what every one must see is a very difficult
      question in this case. Brother Allen, will you take the stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with your case!&rdquo; said Allen, petulantly. The audience laughed, and
      got a warning from the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Harkness,&rdquo; said Wilson, insinuatingly, &ldquo;we shall have to insist
      upon an answer to that question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;well, of course, I do not absolutely know, but in my
      opinion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind your opinion, sir&mdash;answer the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;why, I can't answer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Mr. Harkness. Stand down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The audience tittered, and the discomfited witness retired in a state of
      great embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wakeman took the stand and swore that he saw the twins kick the
      plaintiff off the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The defense took the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wakeman, you have sworn that you saw these gentlemen kick the
      plaintiff. Do I understand you to swear that you saw them both do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo;&mdash;with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that both did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I saw them do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The audience laughed, and got another warning from the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But by what means do you know that both, and not one, did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in the first place, the insult was given to both of them equally,
      for they were called a pair of scissors. Of course they would both want to
      resent it, and so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! You are theorizing now. Stick to facts&mdash;counsel will attend to
      the arguments. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they both went over there&mdash;that I saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they both kicked him&mdash;I swear to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wakeman, was Count Luigi, here, willing to join the Sons of Liberty
      last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, he was. He did join, too, and drank a glass or two of whisky,
      like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was his brother willing to join?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, he wasn't. He is a teetotaler, and was elected through a
      mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he given a glass of whisky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, but of course that was another mistake, and not intentional. He
      wouldn't drink it. He set it down.&rdquo; A slight pause, then he added,
      casually and quite simply: &ldquo;The plaintiff reached for it and hogged it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a fine outburst of laughter, but as the justice was caught out
      himself, his reprimand was not very vigorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Allen jumped up and exclaimed: &ldquo;I protest against these foolish
      irrelevancies. What have they to do with the case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilson said: &ldquo;Calm yourself, brother, it was only an experiment. Now, Mr.
      Wakeman, if one of these gentlemen chooses to join an association and the
      other doesn't; and if one of them enjoys whisky and the other doesn't, but
      sets it aside and leaves it unprotected&rdquo; (titter from the audience), &ldquo;it
      seems to show that they have independent minds, and tastes, and
      preferences, and that one of them is able to approve of a thing at the
      very moment that the other is heartily disapproving of it. Doesn't it seem
      so to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly it does. It's perfectly plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, it might be&mdash;I only say it might be&mdash;that one of
      these brothers wanted to kick the plaintiff last night, and that the other
      didn't want that humiliating punishment inflicted upon him in that public
      way and before all those people. Isn't that possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. It's more than possible. I don't believe the blond one
      would kick anybody. It was the other one that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; shouted the plaintiff's counsel, and went on with an angry
      sentence which was lost in the wave of laughter that swept the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Mr. Wakeman,&rdquo; said Wilson, &ldquo;you may stand down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The third witness was called. He had seen the twins kick the plaintiff.
      Mr. Wilson took the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rogers, you say you saw these accused gentlemen kick the plaintiff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of them kicked him first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;they&mdash;they both kicked him at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you perfectly sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you sure of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I stood right behind them, and saw them do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many kicks were delivered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If two men kick, the result should be two kicks, shouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why yes, as a rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you think went with the other kick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;well&mdash;the fact is, I wasn't thinking of two being necessary,
      this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;I'm sure I don't quite know what to think, but I reckon
      that one of them did half of the kick and the other one did the other
      half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somebody in the crowd sung out: &ldquo;It's the first sane thing that any of
      them has said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The audience applauded. The judge said: &ldquo;Silence! or I will clear the
      court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Allen looked pleased, but Wilson did not seem disturbed. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rogers, you have favored us with what you think and what you reckon,
      but as thinking and reckoning are not evidence, I will now give you a
      chance to come out with something positive, one way or the other, and
      shall require you to produce it. I will ask the accused to stand up and
      repeat the phenomenal kick of last night.&rdquo; The twins stood up. &ldquo;Now, Mr.
      Rogers, please stand behind them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A Voice: &ldquo;No, stand in front!&rdquo; (Laughter. Silenced by the court.) Another
      Voice: &ldquo;No, give Tommy another highst!&rdquo; (Laughter. Sharply rebuked by the
      court.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, Mr. Rogers, two kicks shall be delivered, one after the other,
      and I give you my word that at least one of the two shall be delivered by
      one of the twins alone, without the slightest assistance from his brother.
      Watch sharply, for you have got to render a decision without any if's and
      ands it.&rdquo; Rogers bent himself behind the twins with his palms just above
      his knees, in the modern attitude of the catcher at a baseball match, and
      riveted his eyes on the pair of legs in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready, Mr. Rogers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kick was launched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got that one classified, Mr. Rogers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me study a minute, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take as much time as you please. Let me know when you are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For as much as a minute Rogers pondered, with all eyes and a breathless
      interest fastened upon him. Then he gave the word: &ldquo;Ready, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kick that followed was an exact duplicate of the first one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, Mr. Rogers, one of those kicks was an individual kick, not a
      mutual one. You will now state positively which was the mutual one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The witness said, with a crestfallen look:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to give it up. There ain't any man in the world that could tell
      t'other from which, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you still assert that last night's kick was a mutual kick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I don't, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Mr. Rogers. If my brother Allen desires to address the
      court, your honor, very well; but as far as I am concerned I am ready to
      let the case be at once delivered into the hands of this intelligent jury
      without comment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Justice Robinson had been in office only two months, and in that short
      time had not had many cases to try, of course. He had no knowledge of laws
      and courts except what he had picked up since he came into office. He was
      a sore trouble to the lawyers, for his rulings were pretty eccentric
      sometimes, and he stood by them with Roman simplicity and fortitude; but
      the people were well satisfied with him, for they saw that his intentions
      were always right, that he was entirely impartial, and that he usually
      made up in good sense what he lacked in technique, so to speak. He now
      perceived that there was likely to be a miscarriage of justice here, and
      he rose to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is plain that an assault has been
      committed it is plain to anybody; but the way things are going, the guilty
      will certainly escape conviction. I can not allow this. Now&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, your honor!&rdquo; said Wilson, interrupting him, earnestly but
      respectfully, &ldquo;you are deciding the case yourself, whereas the jury&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the jury, Mr. Wilson; the jury will have a chance when there
      is a reasonable doubt for them to take hold of&mdash;which there isn't, so
      far. There is no doubt whatever that an assault has been committed. The
      attempt to show that both of the accused committed it has failed. Are they
      both to escape justice on that account? Not in this court, if I can
      prevent it. It appears to have been a mistake to bring the charge against
      them as a corporation; each should have been charged in his capacity as an
      individual, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, your honor!&rdquo; said Wilson, &ldquo;in fairness to my clients I must insist
      that inasmuch as the prosecution did not separate the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wrong will be done your clients, sir&mdash;they will be protected;
      also the public and the offended laws. Mr. Allen, you will amend your
      pleadings, and put one of the accused on trial at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilson broke in: &ldquo;But, your honor! this is wholly unprecedented! To
      imperil an accused person by arbitrarily altering and widening the charge
      against him in order to compass his conviction when the charge as
      originally brought promises to fail to convict, is a thing unheard of
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unheard of where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the courts of this or any other state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge said with dignity: &ldquo;I am not acquainted with the customs of
      other courts, and am not concerned to know what they are. I am responsible
      for this court, and I cannot conscientiously allow my judgment to be
      warped and my judicial liberty hampered by trying to conform to the
      caprices of other courts, be they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, your honor, the oldest and highest courts in Europe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This court is not run on the European plan, Mr. Wilson; it is not run on
      any plan but its own. It has a plan of its own; and that plan is, to find
      justice for both State and accused, no matter what happens to be practice
      and custom in Europe or anywhere else.&rdquo; (Great applause.) &ldquo;Silence! It has
      not been the custom of this court to imitate other courts; it has not been
      the custom of this court to take shelter behind the decisions of other
      courts, and we will not begin now. We will do the best we can by the light
      that God has given us, and while this court continues to have His
      approval, it will remain indifferent to what other organizations may think
      of it.&rdquo; (Applause.) &ldquo;Gentlemen, I must have order!&mdash;quiet yourselves!
      Mr. Allen, you will now proceed against the prisoners one at a time. Go on
      with the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Allen was not at his ease. However, after whispering a moment with his
      client and with one or two other people, he rose and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor, I find it to be reported and believed that the accused are
      able to act independently in many ways, but that this independence does
      not extend to their legs, authority over their legs being vested
      exclusively in the one brother during a specific term of days, and then
      passing to the other brother for a like term, and so on, by regular
      alternation. I could call witnesses who would prove that the accused had
      revealed to them the existence of this extraordinary fact, and had also
      made known which of them was in possession of the legs yesterday&mdash;and
      this would, of course, indicate where the guilt of the assault belongs&mdash;but
      as this would be mere hearsay evidence, these revelations not having been
      made under oath&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about that, Mr. Allen. It may not all be hearsay. We shall
      see. It may at least help to put us on the right track. Call the
      witnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will call Mr. John Buckstone, who is now present, and I beg that
      Mrs. Patsy Cooper may be sent for. Take the stand, Mr. Buckstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buckstone took the oath, and then testified that on the previous evening
      the Count Angelo Capello had protested against going to the hall, and had
      called all present to witness that he was going by compulsion and would
      not go if he could help himself. Also, that the Count Luigi had replied
      sharply that he would go, just the same, and that he, Count Luigi, would
      see to that himself. Also, that upon Count Angelo's complaining about
      being kept on his legs so long, Count Luigi retorted with apparent
      surprise, &ldquo;Your legs!&mdash;I like your impudence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we are getting at the kernel of the thing,&rdquo; observed the judge, with
      grave and earnest satisfaction. &ldquo;It looks as if the Count Luigi was in
      possession of the battery at the time of the assault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing further was elicited from Mr. Buckstone on direct examination. Mr.
      Wilson took the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Buckstone, about what time was it that that conversation took place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toward nine yesterday evening, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you then proceed directly to the hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long did it take you to go there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we walked; and as it was from the extreme edge of the town, and
      there was no hurry, I judge it took us about twenty minutes, maybe a
      trifle more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what hour was the kick delivered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About thirteen minutes and a half to ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable! You are a pattern witness, Mr. Buckstone. How did you happen
      to look at your watch at that particular moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always do it when I see an assault. It's likely I shall be called as a
      witness, and it's a good point to have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be well if others were as thoughtful. Was anything said, between
      the conversation at my house and the assault, upon the detail which we are
      now examining into?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If power over the mutual legs was in the possession of one brother at
      nine, and passed into the possession of the other one during the next
      thirty or forty minutes, do you think you could have detected the change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all, Mr. Buckstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Patsy Cooper was called. The crowd made way for her, and she came
      smiling and bowing through the narrow human lane, with Betsy Hale, as
      escort and support, smiling and bowing in her wake, the audience breaking
      into welcoming cheers as the old favorites filed along. The judge did not
      check this kindly demonstration of homage and affection, but let it run
      its course unrebuked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old ladies stopped and shook hands with the twins with effusion, then
      gave the judge a friendly nod, and bustled into the seats provided for
      them. They immediately began to deliver a volley of eager questions at the
      friends around them: &ldquo;What is this thing for?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is that thing for?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Who is that young man that's writing at the desk? Why, I declare, it's
      Jack Bunce! I thought he was sick.&rdquo; &ldquo;Which is the jury? Why, is that the
      jury? Billy Price and Job Turner, and Jack Lounsbury, and&mdash;well, I
      never!&rdquo; &ldquo;Now who would ever 'a' thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they were gently called to order at this point, and asked not to talk
      in court. Their tongues fell silent, but the radiant interest in their
      faces remained, and their gratitude for the blessing of a new sensation
      and a novel experience still beamed undimmed from their eyes. Aunt Patsy
      stood up and took the oath, and Mr. Allen explained the point in issue,
      and asked her to go on now, in her own way, and throw as much light upon
      it as she could. She toyed with her reticule a moment or two, as if
      considering where to begin, then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the way of it is this. They are Luigi's legs a week at a time, and
      then they are Angelo's, and he can do whatever he wants to with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making a mistake, Aunt Patsy Cooper,&rdquo; said the judge. &ldquo;You
      shouldn't state that as a fact, because you don't know it to be a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the reason I don't?&rdquo; said Aunt Patsy, bridling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the reason that you do know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best in the world because they told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't a reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for the land's sake! Betsy Hale, do you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear it? I should think so,&rdquo; said Aunt Betsy, rising and facing the
      court. &ldquo;Why, Judge, I was there and heard it myself. Luigi says to Angelo&mdash;no,
      it was Angelo said it to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Mrs. Hale, pray sit down, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, it's all right, I'm going to sit down presently, but not until
      I've&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must! Well, upon my word if things ain't getting to a pretty pass when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house broke into laughter, but was promptly brought to order, and
      meantime Mr. Allen persuaded the old lady to take her seat. Aunt Patsy
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they told me that, and I know it's true. They're Luigi's legs this
      week, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, they told you that, did they?&rdquo; said the Justice, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, I don't know that they told me, but that's neither here nor
      there. I know, without that, that at dinner yesterday, Angelo was as tired
      as a dog, and yet Luigi wouldn't lend him the legs to go up-stairs and
      take a nap with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he ask for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see&mdash;it seems to me, somehow, that&mdash;that&mdash;Aunt
      Betsy, do you remember whether he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about what Aunt Betsy remembers&mdash;she is not a witness; we
      only want to know what YOU remember yourself,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it does seem to me that you are most cantankerously particular
      about a little thing, Sim Robinson. Why, when I can't remember a thing
      myself, I always&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, please go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now how can she when you keep fussing at her all the time?&rdquo; said Aunt
      Betsy. &ldquo;Why, with a person pecking at me that way, I should get that
      fuzzled and fuddled that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was on her feet again, but Allen coaxed her into her seat once more,
      while the court squelched the mirth of the house. Then the judge said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, do you know&mdash;do you absolutely know, independently of
      anything these gentlemen have told you&mdash;that the power over their
      legs passes from the one to the other regularly every week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regularly? Bless your heart, regularly ain't any name for the exactness
      of it! All the big cities in Europe used to set the clocks by it.&rdquo;
       (Laughter, suppressed by the court.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know? That is the question. Please answer it plainly and
      squarely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you talk to me like that, Sim Robinson&mdash;I won't have it. How
      do I know, indeed! How do YOU know what you know? Because somebody told
      you. You didn't invent it out of your own head, did you? Why, these twins
      are the truthfulest people in the world; and I don't think it becomes you
      to sit up there and throw slurs at them when they haven't been doing
      anything to you. And they are orphans besides&mdash;both of them. All&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Betsy was up again now, and both old ladies were talking at once
      and with all their might; but as the house was weltering in a storm of
      laughter, and the judge was hammering his desk with an iron paper-weight,
      one could only see them talk, not hear them. At last, when quiet was
      restored, the court said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the ladies retire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, your honor, I have the right, in the interest of my clients,&mdash;to
      cross-exam&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll not need to exercise it, Mr. Wilson&mdash;the evidence is thrown
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrown out!&rdquo; said Aunt Patsy, ruffled; &ldquo;and what's it thrown out for, I'd
      like to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so would I, Patsy Cooper. It seems to me that if we can save these
      poor persecuted strangers, it is our bounden duty to stand up here and
      talk for them till&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, there, do sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It cost some trouble and a good deal of coaxing, but they were got into
      their seats at last. The trial was soon ended now. The twins themselves
      became witnesses in their own defense. They established the fact, upon
      oath, that the leg-power passed from one to the other every Saturday night
      at twelve o'clock sharp. But on cross-examination their counsel would not
      allow them to tell whose week of power the current week was. The judge
      insisted upon their answering, and proposed to compel them, but even the
      prosecution took fright and came to the rescue then, and helped stay the
      sturdy jurist's revolutionary hand. So the case had to go to the jury with
      that important point hanging in the air. They were out an hour and brought
      in this verdict:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We the jury do find: 1, that an assault was committed, as charged; 2,
      that it was committed by one of the persons accused, he having been seen
      to do it by several credible witnesses; 3, but that his identity is so
      merged in his brother's that we have not been able to tell which was him.
      We cannot convict both, for only one is guilty. We cannot acquit both, for
      only one is innocent. Our verdict is that justice has been defeated by the
      dispensation of God, and ask to be discharged from further duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was read aloud in court and brought out a burst of hearty applause.
      The old ladies made a spring at the twins, to shake and congratulate, but
      were gently disengaged by Mr. Wilson and softly crowded back into their
      places.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge rose in his little tribune, laid aside his silver-bowed
      spectacles, roached his gray hair up with his fingers, and said, with
      dignity and solemnity, and even with a certain pathos:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all my experience on the bench, I have not seen justice bow her head
      in shame in this court until this day. You little realize what
      far-reaching harm has just been wrought here under the fickle forms of
      law. Imitation is the bane of courts&mdash;I thank God that this one is
      free from the contamination of that vice&mdash;and in no long time you
      will see the fatal work of this hour seized upon by profligate so-called
      guardians of justice in all the wide circumstance of this planet and
      perpetuated in their pernicious decisions. I wash my hands of this
      iniquity. I would have compelled these culprits to expose their guilt, but
      support failed me where I had most right to expect aid and encouragement.
      And I was confronted by a law made in the interest of crime, which
      protects the criminal from testifying against himself. Yet I had
      precedents of my own whereby I had set aside that law on two different
      occasions and thus succeeded in convicting criminals to whose crimes there
      were no witnesses but themselves. What have you accomplished this day? Do
      you realize it? You have set adrift, unadmonished, in this community, two
      men endowed with an awful and mysterious gift, a hidden and grisly power
      for evil&mdash;a power by which each in his turn may commit crime after
      crime of the most heinous character, and no man be able to tell which is
      the guilty or which the innocent party in any case of them all. Look to
      your homes&mdash;look to your property&mdash;look to your lives&mdash;for
      you have need!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prisoners at the bar, stand up. Through suppression of evidence, a jury
      of your&mdash;our&mdash;countrymen have been obliged to deliver a verdict
      concerning your case which stinks to heaven with the rankness of its
      injustice. By its terms you, the guilty one, go free with the innocent.
      Depart in peace, and come no more! The costs devolve upon the outraged
      plaintiff&mdash;another iniquity. The court stands dissolved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost everybody crowded forward to overwhelm the twins and their counsel
      with congratulations; but presently the two old aunties dug the duplicates
      out and bore them away in triumph through the hurrahing crowd, while lots
      of new friends carried Pudd'nhead Wilson off tavern-ward to feast him and
      &ldquo;wet down&rdquo; his great and victorious entry into the legal arena. To Wilson,
      so long familiar with neglect and depreciation, this strange new incense
      of popularity and admiration was as a fragrance blown from the fields of
      paradise. A happy man was Wilson.

      CHAPTER VI. THE AMAZING DUEL
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A deputation came in the evening and conferred upon Wilson the
     welcome honor of a nomination for mayor; for the village has just
     been converted into a city by charter.  Tom skulks out of
     challenging the twins.  Judge Driscoll thereupon challenges Angelo
     (accused by Tom of doing the kicking); he declines, but Luigi
     accepts in his place against Angelo's timid protest.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was late Saturday night nearing eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge and his second found the rest of the war party at the further
      end of the vacant ground, near the haunted house. Pudd'nhead Wilson
      advanced to meet them, and said anxiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say a word in behalf of my principal's proxy, Count Luigi, to whom
      you have kindly granted the privilege of fighting my principal's battle
      for him. It is growing late, and Count Luigi is in great trouble lest
      midnight shall strike before the finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is another testimony,&rdquo; said Howard, approvingly. &ldquo;That young man is
      fine all through. He wishes to save his brother the sorrow of fighting on
      the Sabbath, and he is right; it is the right and manly feeling and does
      him credit. We will make all possible haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilson said: &ldquo;There is also another reason&mdash;a consideration, in fact,
      which deeply concerns Count Luigi himself. These twins have command of
      their mutual legs turn about. Count Luigi is in command now; but at
      midnight, possession will pass to my principal, Count Angelo, and&mdash;well,
      you can foresee what will happen. He will march straight off the field,
      and carry Luigi with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! sure enough!&rdquo; cried the judge, &ldquo;we have heard something about that
      extraordinary law of their being, already&mdash;nothing very definite, it
      is true, as regards dates and durations of power, but I see it is definite
      enough as regards to-night. Of course we must give Luigi every chance.
      Omit all the ceremonial possible, gentlemen, and place us in position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The seconds at once tossed up a coin; Howard won the choice. He placed the
      judge sixty feet from the haunted house and facing it; Wilson placed the
      twins within fifteen feet of the house and facing the judge&mdash;necessarily.
      The pistol-case was opened and the long slim tubes taken out; when the
      moonlight glinted from them a shiver went through Angelo. The doctor was a
      fool, but a thoroughly well-meaning one, with a kind heart and a sincere
      disposition to oblige, but along with it an absence of tact which often
      hurt its effectiveness. He brought his box of lint and bandages, and asked
      Angelo to feel and see how soft and comfortable they were. Angelo's head
      fell over against Luigi's in a faint, and precious time was lost in
      bringing him to; which provoked Luigi into expressing his mind to the
      doctor with a good deal of vigor and frankness. After Angelo came to he
      was still so weak that Luigi was obliged to drink a stiff horn of brandy
      to brace him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seconds now stepped at once to their posts, halfway between the
      combatants, one of them on each side of the line of fire. Wilson was to
      count, very deliberately, &ldquo;One-two-three-fire!&mdash;stop!&rdquo; and the
      duelists could bang away at any time they chose during that recitation,
      but not after the last word. Angelo grew very nervous when he saw Wilson's
      hand rising slowly into the air as a sign to make ready, and he leaned his
      head against Luigi's and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please take me away from here, I can't stay, I know I can't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world are you doing? Straighten up! What's the matter with
      you?&mdash;you're in no danger&mdash;nobody's going to shoot at you.
      Straighten up, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angelo obeyed, just in time to hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; Just one report, and a little tuft of white hair floated slowly to
      the judge's feet in the moonlight. The judge did not swerve; he still
      stood erect and motionless, like a statue, with his pistol-arm hanging
      straight down at his side. He was reserving his fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three&mdash;&ldquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up came the pistol-arm instantly-Angelo dodged with the report. He said
      &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; and fainted again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor examined and bandaged the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of no consequence, he said&mdash;bullet through fleshy part of arm&mdash;no
      bones broken&mdash;the gentleman was still able to fight let the duel
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time Angelo jumped just as Luigi fired, which disordered his aim and
      caused him to cut a chip off of Howard's ear. The judge took his time
      again, and when he fired Angelo jumped and got a knuckle skinned. The
      doctor inspected and dressed the wounds. Angelo now spoke out and said he
      was content with the satisfaction he had got, and if the judge&mdash;but
      Luigi shut him roughly up, and asked him not to make an ass of himself;
      adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I want you to stop dodging. You take a great deal too prominent a
      part in this thing for a person who has got nothing to do with it. You
      should remember that you are here only by courtesy, and are without
      official recognition; officially you are not here at all; officially you
      do not even exist. To all intents and purposes you are absent from this
      place, and you ought for your own modesty's sake to reflect that it cannot
      become a person who is not present here to be taking this sort of public
      and indecent prominence in a matter in which he is not in the slightest
      degree concerned. Now, don't dodge again; the bullets are not for you,
      they are for me; if I want them dodged I will attend to it myself. I never
      saw a person act so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angelo saw the reasonableness of what his brother had said, and he did try
      to reform, but it was of no use; both pistols went off at the same
      instant, and he jumped once more; he got a sharp scrape along his cheek
      from the judge's bullet, and so deflected Luigi's aim that his ball went
      wide and chipped a flake of skin from Pudd'nhead Wilson's chin. The doctor
      attended to the wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the terms, the duel was over. But Luigi was entirely out of patience,
      and begged for one more exchange of shots, insisting that he had had no
      fair chance, on account of his brother's indelicate behavior. Howard was
      opposed to granting so unusual a privilege, but the judge took Luigi's
      part, and added that indeed he himself might fairly be considered entitled
      to another trial, because although the proxy on the other side was in no
      way to blame for his (the judge's) humiliatingly resultless work, the
      gentleman with whom he was fighting this duel was to blame for it, since
      if he had played no advantages and had held his head still, his proxy
      would have been disposed of early. He added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count Luigi's request for another exchange is another proof that he is a
      brave and chivalrous gentleman, and I beg that the courtesy he asks may be
      accorded him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you most sincerely for this generosity, Judge Driscoll,&rdquo; said
      Luigi, with a polite bow, and moving to his place. Then he added&mdash;to
      Angelo, &ldquo;Now hold your grip, hold your grip, I tell you, and I'll land him
      sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men stood erect, their pistol-arms at their sides, the two seconds
      stood at their official posts, the doctor stood five paces in Wilson's
      rear with his instruments and bandages in his hands. The deep stillness,
      the peaceful moonlight, the motionless figures, made an impressive picture
      and the impending fatal possibilities augmented this impressiveness to
      solemnity. Wilson's hand began to rise&mdash;slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;higher&mdash;still
      higher&mdash;still higher&mdash;in another moment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; the first stroke of midnight swung up out of the distance; Angelo
      was off like a deer!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you unspeakable traitor!&rdquo; wailed his brother, as they went soaring
      over the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others stood astonished and gazing; and so stood, watching that
      strange spectacle until distance dissolved it and swept it from their
      view. Then they rubbed their eyes like people waking out of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've never seen anything like that before!&rdquo; said the judge.
      &ldquo;Wilson, I am going to confess now, that I wasn't quite able to believe in
      that leg business, and had a suspicion that it was a put-up convenience
      between those twins; and when Count Angelo fainted I thought I saw the
      whole scheme&mdash;thought it was pretext No. 1, and would be followed by
      others till twelve o'clock should arrive, and Luigi would get off with all
      the credit of seeming to want to fight and yet not have to fight, after
      all. But I was mistaken. His pluck proved it. He's a brave fellow and did
      want to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't any doubt about that,&rdquo; said Howard, and added, in a grieved
      tone, &ldquo;but what an unworthy sort of Christian that Angelo is&mdash;I hope
      and believe there are not many like him. It is not right to engage in a
      duel on the Sabbath&mdash;I could not approve of that myself; but to
      finish one that has been begun&mdash;that is a duty, let the day be what
      it may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They strolled along, still wondering, still talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a curious circumstance,&rdquo; remarked the surgeon, halting Wilson a
      moment to paste some more court-plaster on his chin, which had gone to
      leaking blood again, &ldquo;that in this duel neither of the parties who handled
      the pistols lost blood while nearly all the persons present in the mere
      capacity of guests got hit. I have not heard of such a thing before. Don't
      you think it unusual?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;it has struck me as peculiar. Peculiar and
      unfortunate. I was annoyed at it, all the time. In the case of Angelo it
      made no great difference, because he was in a measure concerned, though
      not officially; but it troubled me to see the seconds compromised, and yet
      I knew no way to mend the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no way to mend it,&rdquo; said Howard, whose ear was being readjusted
      now by the doctor; &ldquo;the code fixes our place, and it would not have been
      lawful to change it. If we could have stood at your side, or behind you,
      or in front of you, it&mdash;but it would not have been legitimate and the
      other parties would have had a just right to complain of our trying to
      protect ourselves from danger; infractions of the code are certainly not
      permissible in any case whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilson offered no remarks. It seemed to him that there was very little
      place here for so much solemnity, but he judged that if a duel where
      nobody was in danger or got crippled but the seconds and the outsiders had
      nothing ridiculous about it for these gentlemen, his pointing out that
      feature would probably not help them to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He invited them in to take a nightcap, and Howard and the judge accepted,
      but the doctor said he would have to go and see how Angelo's principal
      wound was getting on.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [It was now Sunday, and in the afternoon Angelo was to be received
     into the Baptist communion by immersion&mdash;a doubtful prospect, the
     doctor feared.]

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. LUIGI DEFIES GALEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the doctor arrived at Aunt Patsy Cooper's house, he found the lights
      going and everybody up and dressed and in a great state of solicitude and
      excitement. The twins were stretched on a sofa in the sitting-room, Aunt
      Patsy was fussing at Angelo's arm, Nancy was flying around under her
      commands, the two young boys were trying to keep out of the way and always
      getting in it, in order to see and wonder, Rowena stood apart, helpless
      with apprehension and emotion, and Luigi was growling in unappeasable fury
      over Angelo's shameful flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been reported before, the doctor was a fool&mdash;a kind-hearted
      and well-meaning one, but with no tact; and as he was by long odds the
      most learned physician in the town, and was quite well aware of it, and
      could talk his learning with ease and precision, and liked to show off
      when he had an audience, he was sometimes tempted into revealing more of a
      case than was good for the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined Angelo's wound, and was really minded to say nothing for once;
      but Aunt Patsy was so anxious and so pressing that he allowed his caution
      to be overcome, and proceeded to empty himself as follows, with scientific
      relish:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without going too much into detail, madam&mdash;for you would probably
      not understand it, anyway&mdash;I concede that great care is going to be
      necessary here; otherwise exudation of the esophagus is nearly sure to
      ensue, and this will be followed by ossification and extradition of the
      maxillaris superioris, which must decompose the granular surfaces of the
      great infusorial ganglionic system, thus obstructing the action of the
      posterior varioloid arteries, and precipitating compound strangulated
      sorosis of the valvular tissues, and ending unavoidably in the dispersion
      and combustion of the marsupial fluxes and the consequent embrocation of
      the bicuspid populo redax referendum rotulorum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A miserable silence followed. Aunt Patsy's heart sank, the pallor of
      despair invaded her face, she was not able to speak; poor Rowena wrung her
      hands in privacy and silence, and said to herself in the bitterness of her
      young grief, &ldquo;There is no hope&mdash;it is plain there is no hope&rdquo;; the
      good-hearted negro wench, Nancy, paled to chocolate, then to orange, then
      to amber, and thought to herself with yearning sympathy and sorrow, &ldquo;Po'
      thing, he ain' gwyne to las' throo de half o' dat&rdquo;; small Henry choked up,
      and turned his head away to hide his rising tears, and his brother Joe
      said to himself, with a sense of loss, &ldquo;The baptizing's busted, that's
      sure.&rdquo; Luigi was the only person who had any heart to speak. He said, a
      little bit sharply, to the doctor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, there's nothing to be gained by wasting precious time; give
      him a barrel of pills&mdash;I'll take them for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Did you suppose he was going to take them himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's a mistake. He never took a dose of medicine in his life. He
      can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my word, it's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Aunt Patsy, as pleased as a mother whose child is being admired
      and wondered at; &ldquo;you'll find that there's more about them that's
      wonderful than their just being made in the image of God like the rest of
      His creatures, now you can depend on that, I tell you,&rdquo; and she wagged her
      complacent head like one who could reveal marvelous things if she chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy Joe began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma, they ain't made in the im&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shut up, and wait till you're asked, Joe. I'll let you know when I
      want help. Are you looking for something, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor asked for a few sheets of paper and a pen, and said he would
      write a prescription; which he did. It was one of Galen's; in fact, it was
      Galen's favorite, and had been slaying people for sixteen thousand years.
      Galen used it for everything, applied it to everything, said it would
      remove everything, from warts all the way through to lungs and it
      generally did. Galen was still the only medical authority recognized in
      Missouri; his practice was the only practice known to the Missouri
      doctors, and his prescriptions were the only ammunition they carried when
      they went out for game.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by Dr. Claypool laid down his pen and read the result of his labors
      aloud, carefully and deliberately, for this battery must be constructed on
      the premises by the family, and mistakes could occur; for he wrote a
      doctor's hand&mdash;the hand which from the beginning of time has been so
      disastrous to the apothecary and so profitable to the undertaker:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take of afarabocca, henbane, corpobalsamum, each two drams and a half; of
      cloves, opium, myrrh, cyperus, each two drams; of opobalsamum, Indian
      leaf, cinnamon, zedoary, ginger, coftus, coral, cassia, euphorbium, gum
      tragacanth, frankincense, styrax calamita, Celtic, nard, spignel,
      hartwort, mustard, saxifrage, dill, anise, each one dram; of xylaloes,
      rheum ponticum, alipta, moschata, castor, spikenard, galangals, opoponax,
      anacardium, mastich, brimstone, peony, eringo, pulp of dates, red and
      white hermodactyls, roses, thyme, acorns, pennyroyal, gentian, the bark of
      the root of mandrake, germander, valerian, bishop's-weed, bayberries, long
      and white pepper, xylobalsamum, carnabadium, macedonian, parsley seeds,
      lovage, the seeds of rue, and sinon, of each a dram and a half; of pure
      gold, pure silver, pearls not perforated, the blatta byzantina, the bone
      of the stag's heart, of each the quantity of fourteen grains of wheat; of
      sapphire, emerald and jasper stones, each one dram; of hazel-nuts, two
      drams; of pellitory of Spain, shavings of ivory, calamus odoratus, each
      the quantity of twenty-nine grains of wheat; of honey or sugar a
      sufficient quantity. Boil down and skim off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that will fix the patient; give his brother a dipperful
      every three-quarters of an hour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;while he survives,&rdquo; muttered Luigi&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and see that the room is kept wholesomely hot, and the doors and
      windows closed tight. Keep Count Angelo nicely covered up with six or
      seven blankets, and when he is thirsty&mdash;which will be frequently&mdash;moisten
      a rag in the vapor of the tea kettle and let his brother suck it. When he
      is hungry&mdash;which will also be frequently&mdash;he must not be humored
      oftener than every seven or eight hours; then toast part of a cracker
      until it begins to brown, and give it to his brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very well, as far as Angelo is concerned,&rdquo; said Luigi, &ldquo;but
      what am I to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see that there is anything the matter with you,&rdquo; the doctor
      answered, &ldquo;you may, of course, eat what you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And also drink what I please, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly&mdash;at present. When the violent and continuous
      perspiring has reduced your strength, I shall have to reduce your diet, of
      course, and also bleed you, but there is no occasion for that yet awhile.&rdquo;
       He turned to Aunt Patsy and said: &ldquo;He must be put to bed, and sat up with,
      and tended with the greatest care, and not allowed to stir for several
      days and nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one, I'm sacredly thankful for that,&rdquo; said Luigi, &ldquo;it postpones the
      funeral&mdash;I'm not to be drowned to-day, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angelo said quietly to the doctor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will cheerfully submit to all your requirements, sir, up to two o'clock
      this afternoon, and will resume them after three, but cannot be confined
      to the house during that intermediate hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have entered the Baptist communion, and by appointment am to be
      baptised in the river at that hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, insanity!&mdash;it cannot be allowed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angelo answered with placid firmness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing shall prevent it, if I am alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, consider, my dear sir, in your condition it might prove fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tender and ecstatic smile beamed from Angelo's eyes, and he broke forth
      in a tone of joyous fervency:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how blessed it would be to die for such a cause&mdash;it would be
      martyrdom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your brother&mdash;consider your brother; you would be risking his
      life, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He risked mine an hour ago,&rdquo; responded Angelo, gloomily; &ldquo;did he consider
      me?&rdquo; A thought swept through his mind that made him shudder. &ldquo;If I had not
      run, I might have been killed in a duel on the Sabbath day, and my soul
      would have been lost&mdash;lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't fret, it wasn't in any danger,&rdquo; said Luigi, irritably; &ldquo;they
      wouldn't waste it for a little thing like that; there's a glass case all
      ready for it in the heavenly museum, and a pin to stick it up with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Patsy was shocked, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looy, Looy!&mdash;don't talk so, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowena's soft heart was pierced by Luigi's unfeeling words, and she
      murmured to herself, &ldquo;Oh, if I but had the dear privilege of protecting
      and defending him with my weak voice!&mdash;but alas! this sweet boon is
      denied me by the cruel conventions of social intercourse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get their bed ready,&rdquo; said Aunt Patsy to Nancy, &ldquo;and shut up the windows
      and doors, and light their candles, and see that you drive all the
      mosquitoes out of their bar, and make up a good fire in their stove, and
      carry up some bags of hot ashes to lay to his feet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and a shovel of fire for his head, and a mustard plaster for his
      neck, and some gum shoes for his ears,&rdquo; Luigi interrupted, with temper;
      and added, to himself, &ldquo;Damnation, I'm going to be roasted alive, I just
      know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Looy! Do be quiet; I never saw such a fractious thing. A body would
      think you didn't care for your brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't&mdash;to that extent, Aunt Patsy. I was glad the drowning was
      postponed a minute ago, but I'm not now. No, that is all gone by; I want
      to be drowned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll bring a judgment on yourself just as sure as you live, if you go
      on like that. Why, I never heard the beat of it. Now, there&mdash;there!
      you've said enough. Not another word out of you&mdash;I won't have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Aunt Patsy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luigi! Didn't you hear what I told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Aunt Patsy, I&mdash;why, I'm not going to set my heart and lungs
      afloat in that pail of sewage which this criminal here has been prescri&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are, too. You are going to be good, and do everything I tell
      you, like a dear,&rdquo; and she tapped his cheek affectionately with her
      finger. &ldquo;Rowena, take the prescription and go in the kitchen and hunt up
      the things and lay them out for me. I'll sit up with my patient the rest
      of the night, doctor; I can't trust Nancy, she couldn't make Luigi take
      the medicine. Of course, you'll drop in again during the day. Have you got
      any more directions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I believe not, Aunt Patsy. If I don't get in earlier, I'll be along
      by early candle-light, anyway. Meantime, don't allow him to get out of his
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angelo said, with calm determination:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be baptized at two o'clock. Nothing but death shall prevent me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor said nothing aloud, but to himself he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this chap's got a manly side, after all! Physically he's a coward,
      but morally he's a lion. I'll go and tell the others about this; it will
      raise him a good deal in their estimation&mdash;and the public will follow
      their lead, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Privately, Aunt Patsy applauded too, and was proud of Angelo's courage in
      the moral field as she was of Luigi's in the field of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy Henry was troubled, but the boy Joe said, inaudibly, and
      gratefully, &ldquo;We're all honky, after all; and no postponement on account of
      the weather.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. BAPTISM OF THE BETTER HALF
    </h2>
    <p>
      By nine o'clock the town was humming with the news of the midnight duel,
      and there were but two opinions about it: one, that Luigi's pluck in the
      field was most praiseworthy and Angelo's flight most scandalous; the
      other, that Angelo's courage in flying the field for conscience' sake was
      as fine and creditable as was Luigi's in holding the field in the face of
      the bullets. The one opinion was held by half of the town, the other one
      was maintained by the other half. The division was clean and exact, and it
      made two parties, an Angelo party and a Luigi party. The twins had
      suddenly become popular idols along with Pudd'nhead Wilson, and haloed
      with a glory as intense as his. The children talked the duel all the way
      to Sunday-school, their elders talked it all the way to church, the choir
      discussed it behind their red curtain, it usurped the place of pious
      thought in the &ldquo;nigger gallery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By noon the doctor had added the news, and spread it, that Count Angelo,
      in spite of his wound and all warnings and supplications, was resolute in
      his determination to be baptized at the hour appointed. This swept the
      town like wildfire, and mightily reinforced the enthusiasm of the Angelo
      faction, who said, &ldquo;If any doubted that it was moral courage that took him
      from the field, what have they to say now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the excitement grew. All the morning it was traveling countryward,
      toward all points of the compass; so, whereas before only the farmers and
      their wives were intending to come and witness the remarkable baptism, a
      general holiday was now proclaimed and the children and negroes admitted
      to the privileges of the occasion. All the farms for ten miles around were
      vacated, all the converging roads emptied long processions of wagons,
      horses, and yeomanry into the town. The pack and cram of people vastly
      exceeded any that had ever been seen in that sleepy region before. The
      only thing that had ever even approached it, was the time long gone by,
      but never forgotten, nor even referred to without wonder and pride, when
      two circuses and a Fourth of July fell together. But the glory of that
      occasion was extinguished now for good. It was but a freshet to this
      deluge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great invasion massed itself on the river-bank and waited hungrily for
      the immense event. Waited, and wondered if it would really happen, or if
      the twin who was not a &ldquo;professor&rdquo; would stand out and prevent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they were not to be disappointed. Angelo was as good as his word. He
      came attended by an escort of honor composed of several hundred of the
      best citizens, all of the Angelo party; and when the immersion was
      finished they escorted him back home and would even have carried him on
      their shoulders, but that people might think they were carrying Luigi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far into the night the citizens continued to discuss and wonder over the
      strangely mated pair of incidents that had distinguished and exalted the
      past twenty-four hours above any other twenty-four in the history of their
      town for picturesqueness and splendid interest; and long before the lights
      were out and burghers asleep it had been decided on all hands that in
      capturing these twins Dawson's Landing had drawn a prize in the great
      lottery of municipal fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight Angelo was sleeping peacefully. His immersion had not harmed
      him, it had merely made him wholesomely drowsy, and he had been dead
      asleep many hours now. It had made Luigi drowsy, too, but he had got only
      brief naps, on account of his having to take the medicine every
      three-quarters of an hour-and Aunt Betsy Hale was there to see that he did
      it. When he complained and resisted, she was quietly firm with him, and
      said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-no, that won't do; you mustn't talk, and you mustn't retch and gag
      that way, either&mdash;you'll wake up your poor brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it, Aunt Betsy, he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sh-h! Don't make a noise dear. You mustn't forget that your poor brother
      is sick and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick, is he? Well, I wish I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sh-h-h! Will you be quiet, Luigi! Here, now, take the rest of it&mdash;don't
      keep me holding the dipper all night. I declare if you haven't left a good
      fourth of it in the bottom! Come&mdash;that's a good&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Betsy, don't make me! I feel like I've swallowed a cemetery; I do,
      indeed. Do let me rest a little&mdash;just a little; I can't take any more
      of the devilish stuff now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luigi! Using such language here, and him just baptized! Do you want the
      roof to fall on you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to goodness it would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you dreadful thing! I've a good notion to&mdash;let that blanket
      alone; do you want your brother to catch his death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Betsy, I've got to have it off, I'm being roasted alive; nobody
      could stand it&mdash;you couldn't yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, you're sneezing again&mdash;I just expected it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I've caught a cold in my head. I always do, when I go in the
      water with my clothes on. And it takes me weeks to get over it, too. I
      think it was a shame to serve me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luigi, you are unreasonable; you know very well they couldn't baptize him
      dry. I should think you would be willing to undergo a little inconvenience
      for your brother's sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inconvenience! Now how you talk, Aunt Betsy. I came as near as anything
      to getting drowned you saw that yourself; and do you call this
      inconvenience?&mdash;the room shut up as tight as a drum, and so hot the
      mosquitoes are trying to get out; and a cold in the head, and dying for
      sleep and no chance to get any&mdash;on account of this infamous medicine
      that that assassin prescri&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you're sneezing again. I'm going down and mix some more of this
      truck for you, dear.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE DRINKLESS DRUNK
    </h2>
    <p>
      During Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday the twins grew steadily worse; but
      then the doctor was summoned South to attend his mother's funeral, and
      they got well in forty-eight hours. They appeared on the street on Friday,
      and were welcomed with enthusiasm by the new-born parties, the Luigi and
      Angelo factions. The Luigi faction carried its strength into the
      Democratic party, the Angelo faction entered into a combination with the
      Whigs. The Democrats nominated Luigi for alderman under the new city
      government, and the Whigs put up Angelo against him. The Democrats
      nominated Pudd'nhead Wilson for mayor, and he was left alone in this
      glory, for the Whigs had no man who was willing to enter the lists against
      such a formidable opponent. No politician had scored such a compliment as
      this before in the history of the Mississippi Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The political campaign in Dawson's Landing opened in a pretty warm
      fashion, and waxed hotter every week. Luigi's whole heart was in it, and
      even Angelo developed a surprising amount of interest-which was natural,
      because he was not merely representing Whigism, a matter of no consequence
      to him; but he was representing something immensely finer and greater&mdash;to
      wit, Reform. In him was centered the hopes of the whole reform element of
      the town; he was the chosen and admired champion of every clique that had
      a pet reform of any sort or kind at heart. He was president of the great
      Teetotalers' Union, its chiefest prophet and mouthpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the canvass went on, troubles began to spring up all around&mdash;troubles
      for the twins, and through them for all the parties and segments and
      fractions of parties. Whenever Luigi had possession of the legs, he
      carried Angelo to balls, rum shops, Sons of Liberty parades, horse-races,
      campaign riots, and everywhere else that could damage him with his party
      and the church; and when it was Angelo's week he carried Luigi diligently
      to all manner of moral and religious gatherings, doing his best to regain
      the ground he had lost before. As a result of these double performances,
      there was a storm blowing all the time, an ever-rising storm, too&mdash;a
      storm of frantic criticism of the twins, and rage over their extravagant,
      incomprehensible conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luigi had the final chance. The legs were his for the closing week of the
      canvass. He led his brother a fearful dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he saved his best card for the very eve of the election. There was to
      be a grand turnout of the Teetotalers' Union that day, and Angelo was to
      march at the head of the procession and deliver a great oration afterward.
      Luigi drank a couple of glasses of whisky&mdash;which steadied his nerves
      and clarified his mind, but made Angelo drunk. Everybody who saw the
      march, saw that the Champion of the Teetotalers was half seas over, and
      noted also that his brother, who made no hypocritical pretensions to extra
      temperance virtues, was dignified and sober. This eloquent fact could not
      be unfruitful at the end of a hot political canvass. At the mass-meeting
      Angelo tried to make his great temperance oration, but was so discommoded&mdash;by
      hiccoughs and thickness of tongue that he had to give it up; then
      drowsiness overtook him and his head drooped against Luigi's and he went
      to sleep. Luigi apologized for him, and was going on to improve his
      opportunity with an appeal for a moderation of what he called &ldquo;the
      prevailing teetotal madness,&rdquo; but persons in the audience began to howl
      and throw things at him, and then the meeting rose in wrath and chased him
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      This episode was a crusher for Angelo in another way. It destroyed his
      chances with Rowena. Those chances had been growing, right along, for two
      months. Rowena had partly confessed that she loved him, but wanted time to
      consider. Now the tender dream was ended, and she told him so the moment
      he was sober enough to understand. She said she would never marry a man
      who drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't drink,&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing to the point,&rdquo; she said, coldly, &ldquo;you get drunk, and that
      is worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [There was a long and sufficiently idiotic discussion here, which ended as
      reported in a previous note.]

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. SO THEY HANGED LUIGI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dawson's Landing had a week of repose, after the election, and it needed
      it, for the frantic and variegated nightmare which had tormented it all
      through the preceding week had left it limp, haggard, and exhausted at the
      end. It got the week of repose because Angelo had the legs, and was in too
      subdued a condition to want to go out and mingle with an irritated
      community that had come to distrust and detest him because there was such
      a lack of harmony between his morals, which were confessedly excellent,
      and his methods of illustrating them, which were distinctly damnable. The
      new city officers were sworn in on the following Monday&mdash;at least all
      but Luigi. There was a complication in his case. His election was
      conceded, but he could not sit in the board of aldermen without his
      brother, and his brother could not sit there because he was not a member.
      There seemed to be no way out of the difficulty but to carry the matter
      into the courts, so this was resolved upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case was set for the Monday fortnight. In due course the time arrived.
      In the mean time the city government had been at a standstill, because
      without Luigi there was a tie in the board of aldermen, whereas with him
      the liquor interest&mdash;the richest in the political field&mdash;would
      have one majority. But the court decided that Angelo could not sit in the
      board with him, either in public or executive sessions, and at the same
      time forbade the board to deny admission to Luigi, a fairly and legally
      chosen alderman. The case was carried up and up from court to court, yet
      still the same old original decision was confirmed every time. As a
      result, the city government not only stood still, with its hands tied, but
      everything it was created to protect and care for went a steady gait
      toward rack and ruin. There was no way to levy a tax, so the minor
      officials had to resign or starve; therefore they resigned. There being no
      city money, the enormous legal expenses on both sides had to be defrayed
      by private subscription. But at last the people came to their senses, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pudd'nhead was right at the start&mdash;we ought to have hired the
      official half of that human phillipene to resign; but it's too late now;
      some of us haven't got anything left to hire him with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we have,&rdquo; said another citizen, &ldquo;we've got this&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      produced a halter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many shouted: &ldquo;That's the ticket.&rdquo; But others said: &ldquo;No&mdash;Count Angelo
      is innocent; we mustn't hang him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said anything about hanging him? We are only going to hang the other
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that is all right&mdash;there is no objection to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they hanged Luigi. And so ends the history of &ldquo;Those Extraordinary
      Twins.&rdquo;

      FINAL REMARKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      As you see, it was an extravagant sort of a tale, and had no purpose but
      to exhibit that monstrous &ldquo;freak&rdquo; in all sorts of grotesque lights. But
      when Roxy wandered into the tale she had to be furnished with something to
      do; so she changed the children in the cradle; this necessitated the
      invention of a reason for it; this, in turn, resulted in making the
      children prominent personages&mdash;nothing could prevent it of course.
      Their career began to take a tragic aspect, and some one had to be brought
      in to help work the machinery; so Pudd'nhead Wilson was introduced and
      taken on trial. By this time the whole show was being run by the new
      people and in their interest, and the original show was become
      side-tracked and forgotten; the twin-monster, and the heroine, and the
      lads, and the old ladies had dwindled to inconsequentialities and were
      merely in the way. Their story was one story, the new people's story was
      another story, and there was no connection between them, no
      interdependence, no kinship. It is not practicable or rational to try to
      tell two stories at the same time; so I dug out the farce and left the
      tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader already knew how the expert works; he knows now how the other
      kind do it.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
